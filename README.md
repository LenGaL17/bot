# WEREWOLF DISCORD BOT

## DESCRIPTION :
The purpose of this project is to be able to play a game of Werewolf on discord.  
Each player receives a role and the bot takes care of the game itself.  
To do so, I used the **[Discord API]** via the Node.js module called **[Discord.js]**.  
The project is not currently finished.  

## VISUAL :

## INSTALLATION : 
Installation is pretty straight forward, git clone the repo :
```bash   
    git clone https://github.com/pvalentinn/bot.git
```
All you need to do after that is execute the command : `node index` and done !

## COMMANDS : 
All commands are preceded by ``!lg`` :
- `create`, creates a lobby for people to join.
- `join`, allow someone to join the lobby.
- `leave`, exits a lobby.
- `start`, when enough people are in, starts the current lobby.

The whole game logic is yet to come.
